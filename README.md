## My hunch

Here is the simple intuition that will carry this whole piece: space can keep a memory of what happened to it. Not a sentimental memory. A geometric one. Something violent moves through, or a structure forms and later disperses, and the geometry it carved does not relax right away. It lingers. It guides light. It nudges orbits. It biases the expansion a little. 

We label those nudges with big mysterious buckets called dark matter and dark energy. Maybe part of that mystery is just fossil geometry. Curvature that outlived its source. I am going to call it **fossil curvature**. The question is not whether spacetime can curve without matter sitting inside it. General relativity already says yes. The question is whether there could be enough long lived, structured curvature out there to matter at galactic and cosmological scales.

If this idea is right in even a small way, you should be able to see its fingerprints. Not metaphors. Signatures you can go hunt in data.

## What GR already allows, in plain language

General relativity splits curvature into two broad flavors. One flavor is tied directly to stuff. That is the part that says dense regions squeeze volumes. The other flavor is tidal shape change. That one can live in vacuum. Outside a star you are technically in vacuum, yet space is still curved and bends light. Gravitational waves are waves of that shape change moving through empty regions. So the claim that curvature can exist where there is no ordinary matter is not speculative. It is baked in.

The other useful fact: GR happily allows thin geometric features. Cones with a deficit angle. Shells where inside and outside are different and the junction is the whole story. Those are extreme idealizations, but they make one point very cleanly. Geometry can be a thing in its own right.

## Pieces that make fossil curvature plausible

Think of the following as ingredients, not the meal.

**Topological defects and conical cuts.**  
A conical defect looks like you snipped a wedge from a sheet and glued the edges together. Locally the sheet is flat, but globally there is a missing angle. Light passing around the defect does funny things. Two images can appear without the usual shear patterns you expect from a smooth halo. You can imagine more elaborate versions of this idea in three dimensions. Rings, shells, even linked structures. None of these need a blob of cold particles sitting there to do lensing. The geometry is the lens.

**Thin shells and junctions.**  
A spherical shell that stitches two regions of spacetime together can create binding behavior along the shell. Stack a few shells in the right radii and you can coax nearly flat rotation curves without adding invisible mass in the middle. This is not magic. It is the same math that makes the outside of a star curved while the interior solves a different equation. The shell is where the bookkeeping lives.

**Gravitational wave memory.**  
When a big merger throws off gravitational waves, there is a subtle aftertaste called memory. After the wave train passes, free floating test masses end up a tiny bit displaced compared to before. It is permanent in the sense that it does not ring back to zero. That is a literal spacetime scar. The magnitude we have any hope of measuring is small, so memory is not the budget line item for dark matter. I bring it up because it proves a principle. Spacetime can keep a step like change after an event ends.

**Self held curvature lumps.**  
Even if most versions are unstable, there is a long tradition of looking at localized lumps of curvature or radiation that gravitationally hold themselves together. The purpose here is not to resuscitate every old construct. It is to keep our imaginations anchored to something GR does not forbid on day one.

None of these ingredients alone solves the dark sector. Together they sketch a world where geometry is allowed to be more structured and more persistent than the toy pictures we teach.

## The hypothesis in one paragraph

A nontrivial fraction of the phenomena we currently assign to dark matter and dark energy could arise from a network of long lived geometric features in the spacetime fabric. These features include conical deficits, thin shells, ring like defects, and a patchwork of small but permanent shear steps left by past violent events. Locally they can live in vacuum and still bend light or shape orbits. Coarse grained across cosmic volumes they can add an extra effective attraction and inject an extra backreaction term into the average expansion.

If you dislike the word hypothesis, call it a program. It makes predictions you can attempt to falsify.

## What this could explain if it exists

**Rotation curves without parking a halo on every galaxy.**  
Instead of a big smooth NFW-shaped pool of particles, imagine a small stack of geometric shells at the right radii. The effect on orbital speeds can be made similar. The trick is not to overfit. If a minimal shell stack plus the visible baryons matches the rotation data and the weak lensing map with fewer knobs than a classic halo fit, that is real evidence.

**Certain lensing morphologies that look slightly wrong for particle halos.**  
Conical deficits and thin shells create distinctive arrangements of arcs and rings. Defects can give you double images with odd parities and low shear. Shells tend to emphasize thin concentric features. If you comb wide field surveys for those patterns and then do mass modeling, you might find regions where a particle halo model struggles but a geometric model is natural.

**Offset phenomena in cluster collisions.**  
In famous systems where the hot gas lags behind the main lensing peaks, the usual story is that collisionless particles kept going while the gas shocked. A robust fossil curvature model would need to reproduce the lensing gas separation without particulate halos. That is a high bar. It is also the right way to break the idea if it fails.

**A small slice of the late time acceleration budget.**  
Backreaction is a technical word for how inhomogeneities feed into the average expansion rate when you stop pretending the universe is perfectly smooth. Most estimates say the effect is small. A concrete population of shells and defects at the right abundance could amplify it. You can run this through the averaging machinery and see if you get a term that looks like a few percent of dark energy without ruining the cosmic microwave background fit.

## Tests that should happen next

1. **Rotation plus weak lensing cross fits.**  
   Build a template bank for thin shells, conical defects, and simple ring structures. Fit galaxies where we have both good rotation curves and good shear maps. Penalize model complexity. If geometry wins with fewer parameters on a nontrivial subset, that is a bright green flag.

2. **Look for concentric lensing rings and deficit angle doubles.**  
   Use modern survey data to run a search for thin ringy features with low shear and for pairs of images that sit at angles consistent with a missing wedge rather than a smooth halo. Map where those candidates cluster in the sky.

3. **Gaia and gravitational wave catalogs.**  
   When a strong gravitational wave event goes off relatively nearby, search the surrounding star field for tiny step like proper motion changes. You do not expect a big effect. You do want upper bounds. Those bounds tell you how much of the fossil scar budget can come from memory like processes.

4. **Bullet class simulations with geometry baked in.**  
   Take your favorite hydrodynamics code and include thin geometric structures via junction conditions. Crash two clusters and ask whether the resulting lensing map separates from the gas the way the observations do. If the answer is no across a reasonable parameter sweep, that crosses off a big part of the idea.

5. **Backreaction accounting.**  
   Populate a toy universe with a realistic distribution of geometric defects consistent with lensing statistics. Run the averaging and check whether the induced term in the expansion history can matter without wrecking supernova and BAO constraints.

6. **Null predictions for indirect detection.**  
   If a given galaxy is well fit by a geometric model, then particle annihilation signatures should be absent or very low from its halo region. That is a cross discipline way to try to falsify fossil curvature in specific targets.

## Where the idea can break

Energy conditions and microphysics are the obvious pressure points. Certain shell constructions look clean on paper because you let yourself write down a distributional layer that does not care about the sign of pressure or density. Real physics may not tolerate those layers without extra fields or higher curvature corrections. If the only way to keep a shell stable is to smuggle in exotic stress energy everywhere, that is not elegant, it is a red light.

Population statistics are the other killer. To matter for the dark sector, fossil structures have to be common enough and distributed in ways that match the maps we already have. If the required abundance blows through constraints from the cosmic microwave background or from baryon acoustic oscillations, you throw the idea out.

Finally, lensing morphologies are unforgiving. If careful pattern searches in large surveys never find the predicted rings, low shear doubles, or shell like signatures at the required rate, then the door closes.

## Why I like it anyway

I like ideas that tighten the link between what we already know and what we are trying to explain. Fossil curvature does not ask you to rewrite the rules of gravity on day one. It asks you to stop erasing fine structure in the geometry and see whether some of that structure is doing work at scale. It reframes dark matter and dark energy not as monolithic substances but as a budget where geometry might have a line item.

If you are a builder, this is tractable. You can code up the templates. You can scan survey data. You can run the averaging machinery with your inferred defect catalog and publish a number. You can try to kill the idea in a month of nights and weekends. That is the right size for a useful hypothesis.

Space keeps the shape of things that are gone. The only question is whether it keeps enough of those shapes, in the right places, for us to mistake them for invisible matter and invisible pressure. That is not a mystical question. It is an observational one. Let’s go answer it.
